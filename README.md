Hi, I'm **Minidu Thiranjaya Weerasinghe**, a passionate **full-stack** web developer and an undergraduate student specializing in **Software Engineering**. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I love building scalable, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.

---

I'm always eager to learn and explore new tools and frameworks to stay updated with the latest industry trends. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with emerging technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing my knowledge with the developer community.
